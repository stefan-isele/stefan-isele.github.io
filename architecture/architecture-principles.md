# Principles

A Tiny Type is a small class that encapsulates a String or primitive in a domain specific class.

Defining the domain type explicitly provides some advantages :
* Reveal the intent
* Separation of concerns
* Do not repeat yourself (DRY)
* Fail early
* Structure matters
* Naming matters
* Self containment
* Minimize scope
* Locality
* Control the boundaries
