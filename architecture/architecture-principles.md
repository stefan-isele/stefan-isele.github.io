# Principles

Principles are general guidelines for the development process.
They should be followed if possible, but must always be balanced against the costs (effort, complexity).

#### Example
Code or information should not be repeated, 
but sometimes avoiding repetition leads to so much more effort and complexity that repetition must be accepted.  

## The Principles
* Reveal the intent
* Separation of concerns
* Do not repeat yourself (DRY)
* Fail early
* Structure matters
* Naming matters
* Self containment
* Minimize scope
* Locality
* Control the boundaries
