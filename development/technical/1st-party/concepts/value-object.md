# Value Object
A value object is a object that has no identity. Its equality is based on its value only.
This makes value objects different than entities, which have an identity. 

#### Examples :
A date range is a ValueObject.
Two date ranges are equal, if they have the same start and end date.

A user is an entity. Two users with the same name are two different entities eventhough they have the same 'value'.
